# Rational Numbers in LaTeX3

This is a package designed for manipulating rational numbers in
LaTeX3.
At the moment, it doesn't define anything for use at the document
level; rather, it provides utilities that will enable useful stuff in
documents.

## Things this package can do

* Add, subtract, multiply, divide, and compare rational numbers
* Add, subtract, multiply polynomials with rational coefficients
